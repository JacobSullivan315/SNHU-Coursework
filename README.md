# SNHU-Coursework

In this project, I was tasked with developing a program that allows a user to input different amounts for four variables concerning a bank account. The program then used those values to calculate and display how interest compounds in that account, with and without additional monthly deposits. 

Personally, I thought the organization of my classes into neat cpp files, each with h files, was done quite well. The code works efficiently, but the way I set it up allows for anyone to dive in and lter small pieces of the code while minimizing potential damage to the project as a whole if they made a mistake. Keeping these classes and functions separate also improves overall readability, as well.

I could definitely improve in writing more secure code. So far, I have a basic understanding of how C++ works, enough to get by writing simple programs such as this one. However, I know very little of writing code with security in mind. I look forward to learning more about this particular subject, but I feel I am sitll a bit too fresh to programming to approach writing these programs in a way that keeps potential online attacks on these programs in mind. 

At the time of writing this particular project, I was struggling very much with input validation. Specifically, if the user entered an input of the wrong data type. To solve this, I used a tutoring session via SNHU's 24/7 tutoring and they were able to break input validation down in a way the book couldn't for me. We went over a few different hypotheticals of how I would validate which kinds of input, and using this knowledge helped me not only finish this program, but improved my work for the rest of the course.

In terms of what skills I learned here that will help in the future, I would say on top of input validation is class/file organization. I really dove into using multiple files and headers here, challenging myself to learn how to do this effectively. I feel this will help me write neater, more organized, and more readable programs.
